One of my best lectures (for a different class) had the students create a version of Dark Sky’s temperature prediction methods (http://journal.darkskyapp.com/2012/how-dark-sky-calculates-temperature/).
The code would showcase pulling pages from the internet, parsing it, and simple modeling (we’d skip the Voronoi stuff).
I think that should demonstrate the benefits of a general purpose language like Python and code in general vs Excel, etc.
To show off version control, perhaps the two of us could put together something like this on GitHub during January to illustrate collaboration.
It’d take some hours to do a good job with it; do you have the time over Jan 13 to 28?

That looks promising.
The interpolation is something they will be interested in.
We could add in a disk write as well.
In your judgment, is introducing Matplotlib going to be a problem?

So the basic program:
-loads data from online
-parses the data into a grid
-interpolates smoothly using triangulation
-outputs the triangulation into a grid
-writes the grid to disk
-illustrates Git collaboration
